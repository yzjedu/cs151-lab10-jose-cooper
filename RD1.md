Objective:
The objective of this project was to deepen our understanding of working with files, designing and implementing functions, and managing data in the form of tables. The task emphasized the importance of modular programming and file handling, skills that are essential for processing and analyzing large datasets efficiently. The project was a valuable opportunity to practice writing code that is both functional and structured.

Procedure:
The problem-solving process began with referencing lecture notes and ZyBooks to refresh concepts related to file handling and list operations. Each function was designed individually, focusing on a single user option. Functions were tested independently before integrating them into the larger program. This step-by-step approach ensured that each component worked as expected, minimizing debugging in the later stages. For example, the reading and writing file operations were implemented first, followed by functions to calculate statistics or filter data.

Results:
The results met our expectations, and the program performed as intended. The outputs matched the requirements of the problem, and the overall workflow was smooth. However, the output file occasionally became messy due to formatting issues, which could be improved in future iterations. The iterative approach to function design made it easier to pinpoint and resolve any issues during testing.

Reflection:
The most significant challenge was designing and debugging functions to work seamlessly with the provided data. These challenges were addressed by breaking the problem into smaller parts and iterating through trial and error. Following the first three rules of programming—keeping the code simple, clean, and efficient—helped maintain structure and clarity. The most valuable takeaway was realizing how vital file handling is, especially in industries like investment banking, where data analysis is a cornerstone. Working with a partner enhanced productivity and introduced a collaborative problem-solving dynamic, making the process more efficient and insightful. This lab reinforced the practical application of these programming skills in real-world scenarios.
