We were meant to analyze data on movies, their budgets, and their profits. Some key concepts were files, functions, and 
tables. I believe I learned what I was meant to for this lab. I had some difficulty focusing on the assignment due to 
having many other assignments to worry about this week, but I believe it worked out well enough. Working with Jose was 
good because he made an effort to keep in contact with me during the duration of the assignment.
